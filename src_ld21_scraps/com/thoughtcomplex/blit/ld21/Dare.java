Enemies
Mobility mechanics:
	Gun to blast obstacles
	Upgraded Gun, limited charge
	
	Jetpack Cooling Systems (Induction Coils)
	Upgraded Gun Ammo
	
Special Notes:
	the player can decide to move downwards as well, and confront The Deep directly. This is insanely hard and probably even futile.
	Upon rising to the top, the player can choose to get in the Escape capsule or return to the Deep to confront it. Each ending has its strengths and weaknesses, but the simple fact of the matter is that confronting the deep takes more time and effort, so it should just barely be the better ending.
